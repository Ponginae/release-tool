Release Tool
============

If you are starting new project:

```sh
    release-tool init
```

Run this command to generate a `.releaserc` file in an existing project:

```sh
    release-tool init_releaserc
```

Roll the current branch to `dev`:

```sh
    release-tool roll to dev
```

Roll changes from `dev` to `qa`:

```sh
    release-tool roll qa to dev
```
